pattern Module
==============

The `pattern` module provides algorithms for analyzing product diversity and 
recommending relevant items based on historical order data. It serves as an 
assistance system for employees in mid-sized manufacturing companies, helping 
them navigate the complexity of product variations, improve cross-selling 
opportunities, and optimize order history analysis.

Background
----------
In mid-sized manufacturing companies in Germany, product diversity plays a 
crucial role in maintaining a competitive advantage. Unlike mass production, 
these companies often focus on providing **highly flexible, customized product 
variants** to meet individual customer demands. However, this flexibility 
comes at a cost:

- **Growing Complexity**: As new product variations are created, the number of 
  associated components, processes, and logistical parameters increases exponentially. 
  This leads to hidden overhead costs that impact profitability.
  
- **Lack of Product Overview**: Sales representatives and order processors often 
  lose track of existing product variants, leading to unnecessary creation of 
  new items, further increasing complexity.

- **Cross-Selling Challenges**: Employees might overlook important **product 
  bundles** due to lack of knowledge, high turnover, or missing documentation. 
  An intelligent recommendation system can improve customer satisfaction by 
  suggesting relevant **complementary products** and ensuring accurate cost 
  estimations from the start.

Solution
--------
To address these challenges, this module implements **data-driven algorithms** 
that analyze historical product and order data to identify similarities and 
generate intelligent product recommendations. This **AI-powered assistance 
system** supports employees by:

- **Providing a structured overview** of existing products to prevent 
  redundant item creation.
- **Generating recommendations** for **cross-selling** opportunities based on 
  past purchase patterns.
- **Optimizing order history analysis** to improve decision-making in 
  production and sales.

Main Functionalities
--------------------
The `pattern` module includes various functions for data processing and 
recommendation generation:

- **`create_order_matrix()`**: Constructs a structured order matrix mapping 
  **orders (`OrderDocID`) to products (`PartID`)**.
  
- **`compute_similarity_matrix()`**: Computes a **Cosine Similarity Matrix** 
  to measure the similarity between products.
  
- **`recommend_articles()`**: Suggests the **top 10 most relevant products** 
  based on a given shopping list and similarity data.
  
- **`get_products()`**: Extracts and structures product information from the 
  available dataset.
  
- **`read_gzip()`**: Reads and processes compressed CSV data files.

- **`normalize_to_identity()`**: Transforms a given matrix into an **orthogonal 
  identity-like form** using **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**.

- **`add_timestamp_to_filename()`**: Appends a timestamp to filenames, 
  ensuring unique file storage.

Usage Example
-------------
The following example demonstrates how to generate product recommendations 
based on an existing shopping list:

.. code-block:: python

    from pattern.recom_basket import RecomBasket

    # Initialize the recommendation system with order data
    recommender = RecomBasket(data)

    # Generate product recommendations
    shopping_list = {"Item123": 2, "Item456": 1}
    recommendations = recommender.recommend_articles(shopping_list)

    print(recommendations)

This module integrates seamlessly into manufacturing workflows, offering 
**AI-powered insights** to enhance efficiency and profitability.
